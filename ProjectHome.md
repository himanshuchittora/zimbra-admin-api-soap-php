This API is based on the zimbra soap api (web service). It's using PHP5. It allows you to manage easily zimbra accounts, zimbra domains and zimbra servers. There are some missing classes such as COS (class of services), delegate authentication, check password strength, statistics, zimlets...

I wrote this API in order to manage basics features of zimbra. Don't hesitate to add some of them if you need to.
